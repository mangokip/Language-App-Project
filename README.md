# Language-App-Project
**----- CSCE247 Group Project -----**


This is our README for CSCE247's group project for FALL2024. Our group name is "The Benchwarmers"

## Brief Overview
The project that we will be working on this semester is a Java based language-learning application based mostly in the output terminal with various functionalities that simulate actual features present in common language-learning apps. Our version of this project in particular takes inspiration from applications like Duolingo, with the intent to replicate the gamifying of the app while also incorporating meaningful language education. We do not want to lose quality in educational content in favor of the game side.
